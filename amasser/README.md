## Features

- The deck list is stored by the extension - after the initial sync only newly scanned decks are synced.
- Syncing runs in the background - once started the extension popup can be closed without interrupting the sync.
- Syncing can automatically run daily as long as you are logged into MV, DoK, and TCO and the browser is left open.
- Includes fun, inspiring, and thought-provoking quotes to ponder while waiting for the sync to complete.
- Brilliant graphic design that is bright enoough to be seen from space.
